The two men can't agree on who is going to be the best fighter in the fight, and it's fair to say that their differences are far too obvious to allow for any sort of conversation. The only thing that seems clear is that there is a very real possibility that this young man might not be the best guy at his job.

But if you're thinking about what happened last year, don't take my word for it. I'm here to tell you all about it.

In fact, let me give you an idea of just how close we come to being able to have a debate about who should or shouldn't be the best fighter in the UFC.

There was a time when the main event would be held in London, England, where MMA was still fairly unknown. That changed in 2011 when Chris Weidman stepped down from the promotion after he suffered a heart attack. It didn't take long for everyone to find out that Weidman had decided to step away from the sport altogether. He then went on to win the Ultimate Fighting Championship by way of a unanimous decision victory over Georges St-Pierre.

It took a while for other fighters to learn that Weidman was no longer a good fit for the sport. In March of 2012, Daniel Cormier won the lightweight championship against Lyoto Machida, leaving No. 1 contender Conor McGregor (21-5 MMA, 9-2 UFC) behind him. A few months later, Jose Aldo (18-6 MMA, 10-3 UFC) lost his title defense to Fabricio Werdum (17-4 MMA, 8-1 UFC).

And then there were the likes of Michael Bisping (16-10 MMA, 7-0 UFC) and Johny Hendricks (14-9 MMA, 4-1 UFC).

Then there were the big names like Fabio Maldonado (13-8 MMA, 5-1 UFC) and Rashad Evans (12-7 MMA, 3-1 UFC).

Nowadays, there are more than 50 professional fighters competing in the UFC. Some of these fighters have already been booked into the UFC, but many more are still waiting for a chance to prove themselves.

They share a Same nickname, different teachers dynamic. This ends poorly for Christof.  The only way to make him feel good about himself is to let him know that his actions don't have any bearing on what he wants to do in life. He's got to get out there and say 'Hey guys, I'm going to fight this.' And if you're not going to be able to do that, then just keep fighting.

Sturgis is with Irvine and they come up with a plan to satisfy their need to get revenge on the thieves who stole their secrets. They share a Crafter and dealer of illegal martial arts equipment dynamic. This ends poorly for Sturgis.  The crafter's business partner takes them back to his old stomping grounds where they are met with a crowd of thugs who seem to be trying to take advantage of the lack of security at the event.  Sturgis finds out that the only way to keep the gang from stealing their stolen secrets is to steal all of the items, which means no one will be able to sell them to anyone.  Fortunately, the gang has some good ideas about how to solve this problem.  They use a new weapon called the Black Claw, which allows them to shoot people in the face without getting shot.  However, it can also be used to kill any other person in the area.  In order to get rid of the gang, Sturgis would have to find a way to get rid of all of the looters' weapons.  He doesn't want to lose money because he just wants to go buy something again.  But there is more to it than that though.  It's been shown that if you don't give up your guns, you can easily destroy the whole world.  This makes it easier for the gang to take control of the event.  Sturgis realizes that he needs to turn off all of the cameras and stop talking to the audience.  So he goes to the store and buys a gun.  After seeing the video of the robbery, he decides to make a run for it.  He tells everyone that he won't let anyone get hurt, so he leaves the store.  When he comes back, he sees the shop owner standing before him.  Sturgis tries to calm him down by saying that he was just kidding, but the shop owner does not believe him.  And so he turns around and begins running away.  Sturgis then hears the sound of a car being driven by a drunk man.  Sturgis starts running toward the car, but the driver appears behind him.  Sturgis uses his black leather pants to hide his face as he grabs the hood of the car.  His eyes open wide as he hits the ground.  He runs straight through the crowd and jumps into the truck.  Sturgis gets stuck in the middle of the crowd and yells at the driver to leave.  The driver refuses to leave and stumbles across the street looking for him.  Sturgis pulls out his rifle and shoots the driver in the head.  Sturgis says that he isn't going to let anyone get hurt, but the driver replies that he'll do anything to get him out of the truck.  Sturgis gives the driver a big hug and walks away.  Sturgis then notices that the guy driving the truck is holding a sign that says "No Guns".  Sturgis asks the driver if he thinks he can help him get out of the truck.  The driver replies that he can.  Sturgis then calls the cops and tells them that he got hit in the head.  Sturgis then drives off.  The next day, Sturgis works at a local McDonald's.  He earns $6 an hour working there.  He spends most of his time fixing cars.  He loves cooking, reading books, and playing games.  He enjoys drinking beer and doing yoga.  He likes to watch tv.  He owns a lot of things.  He lives in a house with his wife and two cats.  He has a few dogs.  Sturgis is happy to spend time with his family.  He recently gave birth to a baby girl.  Sturgis still believes that he can save the world.  He hopes that someday he will meet someone who will teach him how to live a simple life.  Sturgis wishes he had a job when he was young.  He plans to grow up to be a successful businessman.
Irvine is with Sturgis and they come up with a plan to quench their need to get revenge on the thieves who stole their secrets. They share a Crafter and dealer of illegal martial arts equipment dynamic. This ends poorly for Irvine.  The other characters, however, have an interesting take on the story. In fact, it makes me wonder if there's more to this series than meets the eye. I mean, not only does it have some great action sequences, but it also gives us some truly memorable moments. It's hard to explain all that well, but just remember, you're in the right place at the right time.
Ignazio is with Irvine with one of the artifacts: Wu-Tang Clan fanfiction novella. They share a Divorced dynamic. This ends well for Ignazio.  His relationship with Wu-Tang Clan and their history are strong, but it doesn't stop him from taking advantage of his newfound power.  He's been able to use this power to take control of an organization that he was once considered part of.  The fact that Ignazio has so far managed to hold on to his position is testament to how much he values his new status.
Divorced (by Wu-Tang Clan)
I'm not sure what kind of relationship they have with each other.  In my experience, I don't think they ever really interacted before.  They've always been very close.  It's hard to find someone who can be as close to them as Wu-Tang Clan.  Wu-Tang Clan seems to be extremely loyal to their former leader, and even if they aren't there anymore, they still try to keep in touch.  When they were younger, they wouldn't allow anyone to talk to them about anything.  They'd just leave everything to me.  That's why I didn't know Wu-Tang Clan at all.  Because I didn't know when they were going to get together.  Instead, I knew that they would go back to meet up again soon.  I wanted to see them do something similar.  After all, I wasn't ready to give up hope.
A good deal of Wu-Tang Clan's influence goes into the development of their music.  This is because they're more than just a group of people.  They're a family.  They're a band.  If you look at their past, you can see that they've changed quite a bit over the years.  They've changed a lot since then.  And yet, they still seem to be stuck in the same old ways.  They continue to push forward despite being constantly challenged by outsiders.  Even though they weren't created by Wu-Tang Clan, they still managed to establish themselves as one of the most respected bands in the West.  Their first album, The Last Song, came out in 2012.  It was a huge success.  It had sold over 2 million copies worldwide.  It was the biggest single in Wu-Tang Clan's history.  It was also the highest-selling Wu-Tang Clan album in three years.  All these things combined made it impossible for many people to believe that Wu-Tang Clan was actually a band.  But after listening to the album, I realized that they were indeed a band.  They were pretty much like every other Wu-Tang Clan member.  They could sing, they could dance, they could write songs, they could act, they could play guitar.  They were amazing.  There was a certain amount of pride that went into them.  They were a band that felt like they deserved to be recognized as such.  They were truly a cult.  They gave fans a glimpse into their future.  They were legends.  They were a band that everyone could enjoy.  They were a band that everybody could listen to.  They were a band that nobody could fail to appreciate.  They were a band that everyone could feel comfortable with.  They were a band that everyone could love.  They were a band that everyone could respect.  They were a band that everyone could care about.  They were a band that everyone could become familiar with.  They were a band that everyone could enjoy.  They were a band that everyone could trust.  They were a band that everyone could embrace.  They were a band that everyone could learn from.  They were a band that everyone could enjoy.  They were a band that everyone could fall in love with.  They were a band that everyone could live with.  They were a band that everyone could come to terms with.  They were a band that everyone could make friends with.  They were a band that everyone could hang out with.  They were a band that everyone could spend some time with.  They were a band that everyone could visit.  They were a band that everyone could stay connected to.  They were a band that everyone could celebrate with.  They were a band that everyone could join in on.  They were a band that everyone could enjoy.  They were a band that everyone could be proud of.  They were a band that everyone could tell your friends about.  They were a band that everyone could relate to.  They were a band that everyone could cheer for.

Sturgis is with Christof at Neighborhood Watch fortress (formerly the Weatherford house). They share a Rival stylists secretly collaborating on a new style dynamic. This ends well for Sturgis.  They have been in and out of work together for years, but now they are ready to start their own creative process.  When asked if he would be interested in working with someone like him again, Sturgis says "I'm not sure I want to do that.  It's just something I've always wanted to do.  The only thing I could really say is we're going to get married.  We'll see what happens.  But right now it's my job to help people."  This has led to some good conversations between Sturgis and his wife about how much she cares for her husband.  
Sturgis recently moved into a new home as part of a long-term renovation project.  His wife gave him an idea for a way to stay close to family and friends while also keeping them away from the outside world.  She wants to give Sturgis a chance to reconnect with his inner child.  He is so excited about this idea that he even sent her a picture of himself playing with a toy when he was a kid.  He likes to think that once he gets older, he will be able to play with other kids too.  In fact, he plans to create a miniature version of himself by taking a photo of himself playing with a toy.  He hopes to show others that he can make fun of everything!  If you know anything about our past, please let us know.  Thank you very much for your support!
Irvine is with Sturgis and they come up with a plan to quench their need to get revenge on the thieves who stole their secrets. They share a Crafter and dealer of illegal martial arts equipment dynamic. This ends poorly for Irvine.  The gang has an even bigger problem: The crafters are out to get them, so they try to steal everything they can from them.  They end up being killed by the criminals in the process.
Sturgis is able to use this to his advantage as he fights the villains.  He's also able to control the fight because of how well he handles each foe.  His fighting style is pretty much the same as that of the last two characters.  However, it's not always easy to master.  This time around, he's able to use his grappling ability to dodge some of the attacks.  He's also shown to be quite quick to react to situations.  I don't know if this is what makes him such a great fighter, but I'm sure someone will find out.  It would be nice to see more action from him in the upcoming films.
A lot of people have asked me about the future of Marvel Comics.  If you're reading this far down the road, I hope you've enjoyed the story.  But if you haven't, please check out the next section.

Ignazio is with Irvine with one of the artifacts: Wu-Tang Clan fanfiction novella. They share a Divorced dynamic. This ends well for Ignazio.  He's in the same boat as Wu-Tang, but they have a lot more in common.  Wu-Tang has a very special relationship with him.  The two are also friends.  They're often seen together during school activities.  Their chemistry is similar.  They've been friends for over 25 years.  In their hearts, they're both passionate about music.  Wu-Tang and Ignazio really love each other.  It's hard to explain why this would be such a big deal.  But it's not.  What's important is that we can make sense of it all.  If there's anything I don't understand, please let me know.  I'm happy to help!
